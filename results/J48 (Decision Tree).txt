=== Customer Churn Prediction (Weka - J48) ===

Algorithm: J48 (Decision Tree)
Dataset: IBM Telco Customer Churn
Validation: 10-Fold Cross Validation

Correctly Classified Instances: 5493 (77.99%)
Kappa statistic: 0.3988
ROC Area: 0.758

Confusion Matrix:
    a    b   <-- classified as
 4578  596 |    a = No
  954  915 |    b = Yes

Detailed Accuracy:
Class 'No'  -> Precision: 0.828  Recall: 0.885  F-Measure: 0.855
Class 'Yes' -> Precision: 0.606  Recall: 0.490  F-Measure: 0.541

Weighted Average:
Precision: 0.769  Recall: 0.780  F-Measure: 0.772  ROC Area: 0.758

Summary:
The model achieved 78% accuracy using J48 Decision Tree.
It performs better in predicting customers who stay (No) than those who leave (Yes).
Future improvements may include data balancing or using ensemble methods like Random Forest.
